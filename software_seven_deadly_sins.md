## Software Seven Deadly Wastes

[Jez Halford](http://jezhalford.com/talks)

### Transport

It's usually waste of time and slows things down.

- handovers between teams/developers
- bouncing back and forth between dev/qa
- deploying to different environments

**Fix**: 
- pair developers (fronend/backend)
- CI tools
- automation

### Inventory

- undelivered work
- abandoned work
- work in progress
- working on several things at once. (More stuff you work on, the slower the rate of delivery)

**Fix**:
- reduce your lead time
- visualize your WIP
- stop starting and start finishing


### Motion

- task switching
- irregular meetings
- hot desking
- building new environments

**Fix**: 
- reducing inventory also reduces motion
- get rhythm


### Waiting 

- waiting for other teams
- waiting for outside input
- waiting for clarification

### Over processing

- gold plating
- solving imaginary scaling issues
- writing libraries instead of operational code

**YAGNI - You ain't gonna need it!**

- deliver often
- base performance improvements on evidence
- refactor when you need to

### Over production

- 64% of built software that are rarely or never used
- every feature has a cost
- developing useless features is doubly wasteful

**Fix**:
- strong product ownership
- fast feedback

## Defects 
- bugs in production are bad
- bugs before production are still bad

**Fix**:

- automated tests
- dev/prod parity
- continous integration
- shared understanding

OOPSY - Look up 

1. ship small things
2. automate repettitive
3. do one thing
4. maintain a regular pace
5. fix problems
6. priorities working code over perfection
