Deployed in the cloud and only pay it when it's being used.

**FaaS** - function as a service. 
Write a function and let the platform package and deploy it. 
Because you're paying for the lenght of run, optimization is becoming first actor again. 

when to go serverless?

- depending on the user patterns

Platforms: Amazon Lambda, IBM Cloud, Google Cloud, Azure
